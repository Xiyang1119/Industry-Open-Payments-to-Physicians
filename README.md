## Disclosure Program of Physician-Industry Financial Relationship and Its Effects 

### Excutive Summary

Nation-wide disclosure program Open Payments program brings greater transparency to the physician-industry financial relationships. Although financial interactions between physicians and health care manufacturing companies are under increased scrutiny, physicians’ professional medical activities are still highly dependent on the industry’s financial supports. The total annual payment increased 8.82% from 2014 to 2019. During the studied period, pharmaceutical companies gave various kinds of payments such as gifts and grants to physicians, which may compromise physicians’ independent judgments and rational prescribing. However, the government has not responded to this risk effectively by introducing regulatory policies. Disclosure program should be coupled with reform efforts. Since the collaborations between physicians and pharmaceutical companies are important for medical activities such as researches and experiments, the public authorities should limit the negative effects of industry funding. This report proposes to create an alternative to pharmaceutical industry funding for physicians and professional medical activities. Future regulatory policies should tax health care manufacturing companies and allow independent government entity to allocate the fund to support professional medical activities. Direct industry gifts and financial supports from the medical industry to physicians and their organizations should be prohibited.

### Introduction

Physicians and the medical industry have long interacted on a large scale. A 2007 study revealed that 94% of U.S. physicians had a relationship with industry — 83% received gifts, and 28% received payments for professional services such as consulting or research participation (Agrawal, Brennan & Budetti, 2013). In 2010, the Open Payments program was established through the Physician Payments Sunshine Act and aimed to make financial transactions between the medical industry and physicians transparent to the public. With increased transparency of the financial relationship between physicians and the medical industry including pharmaceutical, medical device, and biotechnology companies, researches to explore the effect of industry-physician relationships has reached a high pitch (Agrawal & Brown, 2016). On the one hand, financial transactions between industry and physicians raise lots of concerns on prescribing and professional behaviors. Payments from the industry can create conflicts of interest by shifting physicians’ prescribing practices in a manner that would benefit the industry’s commercial interests. On the other hand, physicians and the medical industry have long collaborated in scientific discoveries and experiments. Industry funding of research activities has been commonplace for many years (Patel, Yu, Elsolh, Goldacre & Nash, 2018). Although financial interactions between physicians and health care manufacturing companies are under increased scrutiny, physicians’ professional medical activities are still highly dependent on the industry’s financial supports. However, it is unclear that if transparency can reduce the negative impact of pharmaceutical companies on physician behaviors.  

### _What is Open Payments Program?_

Open Payments program was established through the Physician Payments Sunshine Act in 2010. The program requires reporting of payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals by medical product manufacturers and group purchasing organizations (GPO). Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) receive reports from the health care industry on relevant financial interactions and make the information available publicly. The dataset generating process begins with data collection, where applicable manufacturers and applicable GPOs collect payment data for a program year, which runs from January 1 to December 31. Next, the reporting entities submit their data to Open Payments. After submission comes the review, dispute, and correction period when physicians and teaching hospitals review and dispute. Reporting entities can then correct the data during this time as well. Finally, the data is made available on [CMS webpage](https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/browse) for online browsing and downloading. 

### Data Overview

This webpage provides an overview of Open Payments data in 2014, 2016, and 2019. The data visualization was created using general payment (non-ownership and non-research payment) data in the Open Payments database.

#### Total Payments

Total industry payment to physicians increased 8.82%, from $2,109,918,866 in program year 2014 (PY14) to $2,296,025,290 in PY19. It is clear is that 7 years after the Open Payments program, with increased transparency of the financial relationships between physicians and the medical industry, companies continue to make considerable payments to physicians.
 
#### Nature of Payments

The rankings of total payment amount and number of transactions based on the nature of payment were constant in three years. The three categories with the highest total payment were _royalty or license, compensation for services other than consulting, including serving as faculty or as a speaker at a venue other than a continuing education program, and consulting fee in all three years, with total amounts_ in PY19, were the highest among these three categories. _Food & beverage and travel & lodging_ were the most two common types of payments that the medical companies made to physicians in all three years. _Royalty or license, current or prospective ownership or investment interest, grant and charitable contribution_ were the four highest-paid categories in terms of the average single payment in all three years, with _royalty or license ($100,075.66)_ and _current or prospective ownership or investment interest_ ($100,520.19) in PY19 being higher than $100,000 in one transaction on the average.

#### Payments by State

Approximately half of the payments went to the top five states of payment amount in the studied year. In 2014, Physicians in California, New York, Texas, Florida, and Massachusetts received 47% of the total payments amount. The top five in 2019 are the same as those in 2014, with orders of California, Texas, Massachusetts, Florida, and New York accounting for 58%.  49% of all payments in 2016 went to physicians in California, New York, Texas, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. Physicians in California received the highest payments from the industry in all three years, accounting for 22%, 23%, and 21% respectively.

### Effect on Prescribing

One concern of payments from the medical industry is the potential effect on physician prescribing behaviors. According to Blake and Early (1995), 70% of patients in their study believed that payments from the pharmaceutical industry influence physicians’ prescribing behaviors. Recent analyses of industry payments to physicians

#### Study 1 [Evaluating the Strength of the Association Between Industry Payments and Prescribing Practices in Oncology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6516135/)

This study evaluated physician use of orally administered cancer drugs for four cancers:
_Prostate: abiraterone, enzalutamide_
_Renal Cell: axitinib, everolimus, pazopanib, sorafenib, sunitinib_
_Lung: afatinib, erlotinib_
_Chronic Myeloid Leukemia(CML): dasatinib, imatinib, nilotinib_

The study collected data from two main sources, Open Payments data for payments and Medicare Part D for prescribing measurements. It performed an analysis on Open Payments data of the 2013-2015 program years. The outcome was relative prescribing of that drug in 2015, compared with the other drugs for that cancer.
The study found that physicians who received payments for a drug in all 3 years had increased prescribing of that drug (compared with 0 years) for most of the studied cancers except for prostate cancer. Therefore, industry payments are associated with cancer drug prescribing among physicians who received payments consistently

#### Study 2 [Pharmaceutical Industry-Sponsored Meals and Physician Prescribing Patterns for Medicare Beneficiaries](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2528290)

Another study looked at a specific payment nature: payment for food and beverage. It examined Open Payments data from August to December 2013 and found that physicians who attended a single industry meal promoting one of four specific brand-name drugs had significantly higher rates of prescribing those drug over equally effective alternatives from the same drug classes
The studied drug included _Rosuvastatin(statin); Nebivolol(cardioselective β-blocker prescriptions); Olmesartan (ACE inhibitor and ARB prescriptions); and Desvenlafaxine (SSRI and SNRI)._ Physicians who received a single meal promoting the drug of interest had higher rates of prescribing brand-name drugs over other generic alternatives. The findings indicated an association as opposed to the cause-and-effect relationship between payments from the medical industry and prescribing behavior in the studied drug category.

### Conclusion

Financial relationships between industry and physicians have been controversial due to the potential negative influence on physician prescribing practices, which could be the source of conflicts of interest. Although additional evidence is needed before broad conclusions can be drawn, Open Payments data illustrate that industry payments to physicians are widespread in the U.S. Potential influence associated with payments on physicians’ prescribing lends support to the concern that these payments entrench major conflicts of interest in the U.S. health care system.

Open Payments program brings great transparency to the industry-physician relationships, but it doesn’t curtail the conflicts of interest significantly on its own. Regulatory policies and reform efforts should couple with the disclosure program in order to remove conflicts of interest in health care.  For example,  Stanford University Medical Center has banned its physicians from accepting meals or gifts and participating in speaking activities. 
However, collaborations with industry and financial supports from pharmaceutical companies are important for physicians and professional medical activities. Therefore, the goverment need to create an alternative to limit the source of the conflicts of interest. Reform policy should include tax pharmaceutical firms to support crucial professional activities. A government-sponsored independent entity should distribute these funds. Meanwhile, legislation should prohibit gifts and financial supports such as donations and funds directly to physicians. Moreover, individual physicians should take a stance against industry influences and always put their patients’ need first
